title: Building a chicken coop
---

We bought 2 baby chicks and want to build them a house. At present, we are keeping them both in the garage. Garage is littered with their poop now. We find that we have to clean it once evey week. During the day, we take the chicks to the green house where they are kept warm and have some dirt for them to strach.

We bought the chicks from an advertisement we saw on preloved.com on the 29th June. The advertisement said £2, however; when we went there to buy two chicks, the seller told us he won't be able to gurantee the sex of the chicks. Unless we bought another breed where he can garentee it to be hens. And that costs us £12 for each chick. We also bought half a bag of the hens food from the same person for £10. The seller told us the chicks were 4 days old at the time.

When I was a &nbsp;kid and living in Kerala, India, we had chickens in our house. I feel very nostalgic when I think about my experiences watching the hens, feeding them and especially the cuteness of baby chicks. In UK, one of the thing we had to sacrifice was the amount of available space/land. Me and my parents initially lived in a flat in Chelmsford, then moved to a rented house of which I can't even remember a back garden. When my parents bought a house, that house had a decent size back garden. Enough to house a shed, grow few flowers and vegetables, and also have some space to sit confortably. However, still not enough space to house a chicken coop. UK for this reasons have never felt home for us. I suspect this is the case for majority of the migrants from Kerala. I've wondered if there are things one can do to change this feeling of home sickness.

The main problem is the weather. I am writting this in July, in the middle of the summer season and today's temperature reached 27 degrees celcius. For me, I am confirtable not wearing a jacket if the temperature is above 12 degrees celcius. And in England that is typically from April to September. Only a mere 6 months. When its dull weather including the weather in those 6 months, I find myself needing an extra push to go outside. In Kerala (Kottayam district) on the other hand can reach temperatures of up to 37 degrees Celsius in summer. And I don't think it dips below 20 degrees at its coldest.

I have cherished memories of playing cricket in a field with kids older than me in scortching heat. My feet burning as I touch the ground with my bear foot. Going to a convenient store afterwards drinking a cold glass of salted soda lime juice with my friends and riding to everywhere on our MTBs. I could always jump into a small river without worrying that the water might be too cold. I remember feeling the joy of bathing in the river that was next to cousin's house. Or the one right behind my grandparent's house (Kuttanadu, Kerala). Not only the kids, the grown ups also had fun.

Sun always used to rise at 6am and set at 6pm. As a kid, I had never questioned this or hadn't realised that this was not the case everywhere in the world. I love it in England during summer because there is more daylight. My hapiness drops every year on the Summer solace and rises every year on the Winter solace. I eagerly look forward at my phone's weather app to see what time the sun rises each day. I am the happiest when sun rises before 7am.

When I bought my first house, we knew we wanted to have a good size back garden. My wife loves being outside in garden and growing our own. It took me almost 3 years after marriage to understand this pleasure. We were lucky to buy a house with a very big back garden. Still not as big as the land we had in Kerala. However, bigger compared to most of other houses we've seen. We now have enough space in our garden to build a chicken coop.

## Inspiration

There are a lot of videos on youtube that gives a walkthrough of chicken coops. I haven't come across one that was a UK chicken coop. There are plenty of US chick coop videos. However, the most inspiring and satisfying video I watched was by Pask. Ever since I first watched his video, I have wanted to build the same one.
