title:  Migrate Blog to Jekyll and Hosted on GitHub Pages
---

I've had this blog migrated so many times in the past. I had it running in 
Jekyll and GitHub pages when I first started blogging. 

Then I switched to using Ghost blogging platform self hosted.

I switched out of Ghost in favour of Gatsby to get on the Single page app train.
Hosted the blog on Netlify with its free tier. 

I then switched back to Ghost and self hosting it on Kubernetes.

And now, I am back to full circle running the site using Jekyll and Hosting it 
back on GitHub pages.

I even considered using the Hey World blogging platform for a while. But, that 
was way too simple for me. It has got potentials and I will wait and see if it 
grows into something more to meet my needs in the future. 

## Taking a break from Ghost
I am not using the full feature offered by Ghost. I don't need mostly all of 
them. I don't have subscriber, I don't need to send out emails to anyone. I 
don't plan to use the blog as a revenue stream. 

I enjoyed the default theme, I loved its integration with cloudflare for image 
uploads. I am planning to continue using Cloudflare to serve the images for my
blog.

Running a kubernetes cluster for my blog and couple of side projects is turning 
out to be expensive. I would like to have the oppertunity to turn the 
Kubernetes Cluster off without bringing down my blog.

## Why Jekyll
I think the main reason is because of its simplicity. I already have tools 
needed for running jekyll on my workstation. I am becoming more familiar with 
the ecosystem nowadays. I like the concept of simply HTML getting served. That's
all I need from a Blog. There is no need for server rendering, no need for lots 
of JavaScript to be executing in my reader's Browser.

I like the freedom of writting on Markdown, saving it to GIT and having a bit 
more control over the customization. 

I will have to make the site look more appealing. Need to do some UI 
improvements. Have to take care of my mobile audiences. 

## Conclusion
Who knows, I might decide to move away from Jekyll in some time in the future. 
But for now, I enjoy the simplicity of just writing and pushing the content to 
the world.
