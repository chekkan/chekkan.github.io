I had a colleague recently asked me "how do I improve and work on my technical 
skills?". I am in no disillusion that I was asked because of my incredible 
technical knowledge. I think they were told to ask others in the team and I was 
included as part. But, surely the question deserved the best answer I could 
provide them with. When I started writing a response, I realised that others 
who are starting on the software development path will also have these 
questions. Perhaps, I should blog it so that perhaps someone else can benefit 
from my experience. 
  
I have a list of blogs that I track with RSS readers. Also, I follow the writer 
of these blogs on Twitter. Whenever I come across something interesting, I will 
add the blog to RSS readers. Same for Twitter, I will follow people who I find 
interesting with regards to technology and thinkers in our field. Examples 
include Martin Fowler, Scott Hanselman, Uncle Bob, David Heinemeier Hansson, 
Grady Booch, Kent Beck, Suz Hinton, Mark Seemann, etc. I read what they have to 
share from time to time.  
  
I read technical books whenever I can. It used to be that I watched a lot of 
Pluralsight videos (or something similar) before, to learn a particular 
technology. I still watch them; but not as much as I used to. I also watch a 
lot of YouTube videos from conferences, particularly keynotes. They always seem 
to inspire me or change my way of thinking. Of course, over the years, I have 
developed a list of favourite speakers. So, I make sure to listen to their 
keynotes in particular.   
  
But, I am finding reading books more useful nowadays. It takes a lot longer to 
finish the books. However, I am getting a much better understanding from them. 
Similar to reading books, I have also started to push myself to read more code. 
So, whenever there is a pull request to review, I take that as an opportunity 
to read other people's code.   
  
I think writing is another important habit to develop. It doesn't matter if the 
writing is in the form of a blog, or a personal diary. I am finding that 
reading books helps me to write better which in turn is helping me to write 
better code.   
  
Teaching others or sharing what you've learned also helps in solidifying your 
learnings. That's the main reason I am blogging. It doesn't matter if no one 
reads them.
