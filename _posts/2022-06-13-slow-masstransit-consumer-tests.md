[MassTransit][] is an open source library that is an abstraction over some of
the popular messaging/bus technologies. I have used it for interacting with
RabbitMQ bus and have found the experience very pleasant.

There is a pitfall that most developers fall into (myself including) when
writing a test for MassTransit _consumer_. In the below example test, asserting
for message not to be published will only return to the caller after the
default timeout of **6 seconds** has passed.

```csharp
[Fact]
public void Message_not_published()
{
    sut.Login(lockedOutUser);
    testHarness.Published.Select<IUserLoggedIn>()
      .Should().BeEmpty();
}
```

General advice ðŸ«¡ is to not write tests that asserts something didn't happen.
Rethink how you can rewrite the test when you reach for this.

If absolutely necessary, you can pass in an optional `CancellationToken` to
the `Select` method that times out after a set period.

```csharp
[Fact]
public void Message_not_published()
{
    sut.Login(lockedOutUser);
    using CancellationTokenSource cts = new ();
    cts.CancelAfter(100);
    testHarness.Published.Select<IUserLoggedIn>(cts.Token)
      .Should().BeEmpty();
}
```

You can override the default timeout value by setting `TestInactivityTimeout`
property on the `TestHarness`.

```csharp
/// <summary>
/// Timeout specifying the elapsed time with no bus activity after which the
/// test could be completed
/// </summary>
public TimeSpan TestInactivityTimeout { get; set; }
```

Another permutation of the above assertion is _counting_ the number of messages
published. This will also wait till the timeout period. However, `Count`
doesn't have an _overload_ that takes in a `CancellationToken`.

```csharp
testHarness.Published.Count().Should().Be(2);
```
